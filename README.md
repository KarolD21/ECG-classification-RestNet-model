# ðŸ©º PTB-XL ECG Signal Processing & Classification

This repository processes ECG signal data from the [PTB-XL dataset](https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/1.0.3/), a large clinical 12-lead ECG database published on PhysioNet. The pipeline includes data loading, preprocessing, and feeding signals into a deep learning model for multi-label classification of cardiac conditions.

## ðŸ§ª Input Format

- **Input Signals:** Raw 12-lead ECG signals, each sampled at 500Hz, typically 10 seconds in duration.
- **Labels:** Diagnostic statements (e.g., myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation) mapped to multi-hot encoded vectors for training.

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

The deep learning model implemented in `model.py` is designed for **multi-label classification of ECG signals** from the PTB-XL dataset. It takes preprocessed 1D ECG waveforms as input and outputs a probability vector representing the presence of various cardiac conditions.

### ðŸ”§ Key Features

- **Input Shape**:  
  12-lead ECG signals, typically shaped as `(batch_size, 12, 5000)`  
  (10 seconds per sample at 500 Hz sampling rate)

- **Architecture**:  
  A custom neural network built using:
  - **1D Convolutional Layers** to extract temporal and spatial features from the waveforms
  - **Batch Normalization** and **ReLU** activation to stabilize and accelerate training
  - **Global Average Pooling** or **Flattening** to reduce dimensionality
  - **Fully Connected Layers** for final classification over multiple diagnostic labels

- **Output**:  
  A vector of logits representing the likelihood of each diagnostic class.  
  Apply `sigmoid` to convert the logits to probability scores for each label.
